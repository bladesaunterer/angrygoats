Client:Hello, are you mister Ndoto?
Ndoto:That's DOCTOR Ndoto to you, stranger. What business do you have with me?
Client:I've heard that you can help me with a little problem of mine.
Client:A 'fear' problem.
Ndoto:Say no more. Come closer.
None:*THONK* (Ndoto forces a mask onto the client’s face.)
Client:WHAT THE… WHAT IS THIS MASK?!.
Client:WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! WHAT’S HAPPENING!?.
Ndoto:Calm down. It’s just normal procedure.
None:(The doctor waves his hand over the client’s mask.)
Ndoto:Hmmm, Spiders huh. Such a ridiculous fear. 
Ndoto:*sigh* But I suppose a job’s a job.
Ndoto:Give me a few minutes. I expect proper compensation for this.
