:(In a secluded hut, far from any modern civilization…):DisableB
Client:Hello? Anyone here?:EnableR
:(A caped figure approaches the man from the darker corners of the hut.)
Client:Hello, are you Mister Ndoto?
Dr. Ndoto:That's DOCTOR Ndoto to you, stranger. What business do you have with me?:EnableL
Client:I've heard that you can help me with a little problem of mine.
Client:A 'fear' problem.
Dr. Ndoto:Say no more. Come closer.
:*THONK* (Ndoto forces a mask onto the client’s face.)
Client:WHAT THE… WHAT IS THIS MASK?!
Client:WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! WHAT’S HAPPENING!?
Dr. Ndoto:Calm down. It’s just normal procedure.
:(The doctor waves his hand over the client’s mask.)
Dr. Ndoto:Hmmm, spiders huh. Such a ridiculous fear.
Dr. Ndoto:*Sigh*
Dr. Ndoto:But I suppose a job’s a job.
Dr. Ndoto:Give me a few minutes. 
Dr. Ndoto:I expect proper compensation for this.
:(Dr. Ndoto brings his staff to the client's face and enters the client's mind.)
